# Introduction
# Greetings!
Hi my name is Zavier Paulino! I am student living in Springfield, NJ, I'm still inexperienced when it comes to coding in general. I have worked on a few projects in my time as an undergraduate, and even now I am dabbling in passion projects here and there, but as technology is ever changing I am forever trying to learn and re-learn basics and advanced conepts.

I've learned a bit about Java and have some experience with it as an object oriented programming, but my knowledge is still limnited. Some other languages I've learned a small amount of are: Python, C#, and Swift.
I am participating in this coding bootcamp with the hope that I can learn more about Java and the tech field in general, so I am looking forward to what this has in store.
